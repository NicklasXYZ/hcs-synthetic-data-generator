# Overview

The code repository [hcs-synthetic-data-generator](https://github.com/NicklasXYZ/hcs-synthetic-data-generator) contains code for running a discrete-event simulation modeling patient-practitioner interactions in a healthcare system. Details relating to the implemented simulation can be found on [here](sim.md), while a resulting benchmarking data set can be found [here](vis.md).
